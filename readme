How to Run
In a Python Script:

Save the code to a file (e.g., enhanced_matplotlib_flower.py).
Run python enhanced_matplotlib_flower.py. A window will open with the interactive animation. Close the window to stop.
In Jupyter Notebook (Recommended for Interactivity):

Open Jupyter: jupyter notebook.
Create a new notebook.
In the first cell: %matplotlib notebook (enables interactive plot with zoom/pan).
In the second cell: Paste the entire code (excluding the Jupyter comment) and run it.
The animation will play interactively in the output cell. Use %matplotlib inline if you prefer static frames, but notebook mode is better for animation.
To save: Uncomment the ani.save() lines and run—the files will save to your current directory.
Customization:

Timings: Edit variables like bloom_duration or sway_speed at the top and re-run.
FPS for Saving: Change fps = 30 (e.g., to 60 for faster playback). Higher FPS makes the animation quicker but may require more processing.
Colors: The seaborn palette auto-generates vibrant colors; change "husl" to "Set2" or another for different schemes.
PathPatch Petals: The petal path is customizable—adjust verts in create_petal_path for even more complexity (e.g., add more curves).
Output and Performance
Animation Length: ~20 seconds at 30 FPS (loops indefinitely when displayed).
Visuals: Complex petals curve realistically; labels guide the viewer; swaying affects the title for immersion.
File Sizes: GIF ~5-10 MB; MP4 ~2-5 MB (depending on FPS).
Troubleshooting: If FFmpeg isn't found for MP4, install it (e
